## Personal Background

I am a formerly retired teacher and administroator with 30+ years of experience in education. 
Born and raised in Oakland CA, I have a passion for providing positive educational experience for all students with a focus for developing 
STEM experience particularly focused on underserved students. I came out of retirement to work on Curated Pathways to Innovation™ (CPI™), a 
non-profit prorgam which created a personalized learning platform to broaden and diversify the STEM+C pipline. 

There is a critical need to solve the Broadening Participation challenge in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) in the United 
States. The US STEM-C workforce isn’t representative of the population and is falling behind. The underrepresentation of minorities and women
in STEM persists, impacting U.S. competitiveness. In Silicon Valley, a recent estimate counted over 100 local STEM education programs. 
However, no common platform exists for consistent and shared outcomes measurement. The outcomes that do exist are questionable because with 
the resources invested, the needle hasn’t moved forward in terms of female and minority representation in computing, and STEM overall.
 
A web-based app, CPI™ acts as a “virtual guidance counselor” and uses gamification to engage students – they can select activities that build interest and engagement while building their curated pathways.

The key ingredient of CPI™ is a platform that incents and enables a student’s success along their journey. A robust recommendation algorithm guides them on their individual path and helps them make critical choices. What courses are available at school? Which is the right course for me? How can I choose? Once I’ve completed this course, how do I know what to do next? What are my options?
